SUMMARY:CodeWars
DESCRIPTION:Room: CodeWars Venue\nPresenters: \n120min Social Event\n*Please
  sign up for the event at http://codewarpyconau.eventbrite.com/ *\n\nOrigin
 ally based on an idea from the book PeopleWare\, CodeWar has been run in co
 njunction with the Sydney WebDU conference since 2008 with great success. T
 o help share the mayhem we're proud to bring CodeWar to PyCon-au 2010\, wit
 h experienced CodeWar compare Robin Hilliard from RocketBoots on the microp
 hone to keep a wry eye on proceedings.\n\nThe competition will consist of t
 hree rounds of differing programming challenges.\n\nWe guarantee this won't
  be mind twisting problems for algorithm heads and you can compete with wha
 tever language you want. It will help to have a team with a mix of skills\,
  a clever and/or intimidating team name and vocal cheer squad. However the 
 only thing your team must bring is a single laptop with a VGA connector run
 ning in 1024x768 mirrored mode.

SUMMARY:Easy site migration using Diazo and Funnelweb
DESCRIPTION:Room: Grand Lodge\nPresenters: Mr. Adam Terrey\n45min Beginner\n
 categories: \nMoving old sites into a new web platform is a pain. Often you
  need to pull apart perfectly good HTML just to spend time painstakingly pu
 tting back together again and converting hundreds of pages of content is a 
 chore. Recently PretaWeb used tools to drastically simplify this process wh
 en converting genetics.edu.au to Plone 4.1. Diazo is a platform independent
  theming engine that leaves HTML untouched. Funnelweb is a static content m
 igration tool for crawling and manipulating site content.

 yer user-created-content platform video game written in Pygame. It's a bit 
 like a cross between a wiki and a game\, because the players can also creat
 e and edit the levels. In this talk we will look at the development of the 
 game over the last three years\, including what has changed since PyCon 201
 0. We'll examine the sound\, graphics\, and networking architecture which i
 s built upon pygame and asyncore (PodSixNet). We will also discuss the comm
 unity that has arisen around this project and go over building the game fro
 m source and how to contribute.\nhttp://infiniteplatformer.com/

SUMMARY:Behaviour Driven Development
DESCRIPTION:Room: Grand Lodge\nPresenters: Mr. Malcolm Tredinnick\n30min Int
 ermediate\ncategories: \nWriting software in an organisation or for ourselv
 es\, many people feel that they "should" somehow be doing Test Driven Devel
 opment (TDD) because "everybody else" is and it's cool\, somewhere between 
 necessary and useful and they heard testing was good. When informed that mu
 st of TDD isn't about testing (despite the name!)\, confusion reigns.\n\nBe
 haviour Driven Development is a different way of approaching the "how to va
 lidate your code" problem. It's an idea that isn't particularly new any mor
 e\, but it doesn't seem to have the traction of TDD for some reason\, parti
 cularly in Python\, despite possibly being a bit more self-explanatory and 
 easier to bootstrap when sitting down to write code. So let's talk about wh
 at it is and various ways to try out BDD in Python — from the periodically 
 maligned doctests to simple unittest module usages to more specialised modu
 les.

SUMMARY:Weather field warping using Python.
DESCRIPTION:Room: Ionic\nPresenters: Dr. Nathan Faggian\n30min Beginner\ncat
 egories: \nPython is a great language for prototyping computer vision algor
 ithms\, the availability of libraries such as Numpy and Scipy make for rapi
 d development similar to that of Matlab\, R and IDL. At the Bureau of Meteo
 rology (BoM) we are solving the interesting problem of weather field warpin
 g. Warping (aka non-linear image registration) is used\, for example\, to d
 etermine what the predicted temperature will be hourly if we only have pred
 ictions every three hours. Practically\, warps (weather advection fields) a
 re estimated using salient image features or data-driven numerical optimiza

SUMMARY:Sysadmins vs Developers\, a take from the other side of the fence
DESCRIPTION:Room: Ionic\nPresenters: Mr. Benjamin A Smith\n30min Intermediat
 e\ncategories: \nA 30 minute foray into the world of the system administrat
 or\, focusing on situations shared between sysadmins and developers\, howev
 er differ from perspective\, motivations and problems.\n\nThe primary goal 
 here is to provide some light hearted anecdotes\, examples and situations\,
  that developers will relate to from their experiences and garner a new app
 reciation for the role of the sysadmin.\nOne of the secondary goals of this
  talk is to equip developers with a new mindset and avenues to engage their
  support teams to reduce friction and extract additional value form the sys
 admin/developer relationship.

SUMMARY:Hosting Python Web Applications
DESCRIPTION:Room: Grand Lodge\nPresenters: Mr. Graham P Dumpleton\n30min Int
 ermediate\ncategories: \nWeb applications which are able to dynamically del
 iver up content have become a crucial part of the Internet landscape\, with
  Python becoming an increasingly popular choice for the implementation of a
 ll manner of web applications. In order though for users to be able to acce
 ss your web application you need to host it. The choices available are howe
 ver many and varied with accurate information on which may be a good choice
  not always easy to find.\n\nThis talk will give an overview of the differe
 nt choices available for hosting Python web applications. It will cover mai
 nstream web servers such as Apache and nginx\, highlight the architectural 
 differences between them and look at how Python web applications are bolted
  on to these web servers via language agnostic protocols such as FASTCGI/SC
 GI/AJP or more integrated solutions such as Apache/mod_wsgi and uWSGI. The 
 alternate architecture of using a standalone Python web server such as guni
 corn\, Paste server or the CherryPy WSGI server behind a conventional web s
 erver acting as HTTP proxy will also be covered.\n\nThe overall aim of the 
 talk will be to give people a better appreciation for how web servers and y
 our Python web application come together and some of the pros and cons of d
 ifferent solutions.

 "\n\nThe topics discussed are:\n\n- speech and image recognition (how to be
  head-hunted by Google)\n- bioinformatics (how to cure cancer)\n- statistic
 al modelling (how to predict the stock market)\n\nThe intended audience is 
 graduates in science and engineering disciplines; Python users who want to 
 know more about what's possible with tools like NumPy and SciPy; and users 
 of high-level packages like Matlab or R and low-level languages like Fortra
 n who want to get more interesting work done with less effort.

SUMMARY:Teaching Python to the young and impressionable
DESCRIPTION:Room: Ionic\nPresenters: Georgina Wilcox\, Miss Katie M Bell\n30
 min Beginner\ncategories: \nWe present two outreach programmes run by Sydne
 y University for high school students: the National Computer Science School
  (http://www.ncss.edu.au) and the Girls’ Programming Network (http://sydney
 .edu.au/it/gpn). For the past four years we have been teaching Python to st
 udents in grades 9-12\, and based on this experience we will discuss why Py
 thon is a good first language and the parts of it which are still difficult
  for students to grasp. We will also cover the structure of the programmes 
 and tools used\, in particular the online marking system for Python program
 ming tasks.

SUMMARY:Say What You Mean: Meta-Programming a Declarative API
DESCRIPTION:Room: Grand Lodge\nPresenters: Dr. Ryan F Kelly\n30min Intermedi
 ate\ncategories: \nThis talk will explore the use of python's meta-programm
 ing facilities to create a simple declarative API so that you can *say what
  you mean* - write code that focuses on the what and the why without being 
 cluttered by the how.  If you've ever wondered how the Django ORM or SQLObj
 ect work their magic\, this is the talk for you.\n\nAs motivating example a
 nd case study\, I will build from scratch a basic clone of the "dexml" modu
 le\, which lets you work with XML documents in a declarative\, object-orien
 ted manner.  Through judicious use of decorators\, descriptors and metaclas
 ses\, it packs a lot of logic and functionality into a very thin API.

SUMMARY:The NCSS Challenge: teaching programming via automated testing
DESCRIPTION:Room: Ionic\nPresenters: Mr. Tim Dawborn\n30min Intermediate\nca
 tegories: \nThe NCSS Challenge (http://challenge.ncss.edu.au/) is an online
  programming competition for Australian high school students. There are fou
 r different courses being run during 2011: Introductory Python\, Intermedia
 te Python\, Advanced Python\, and Embedded Systems (using the Arduino). In 
 2010 we had over 1700 students participate in the Challenge.\n\nThere are a
  number of interesting technical challenges which had to be overcome in ord
 er to facilitate such a system. Executing arbitrary code on your servers wh
 ich is supplied somebody on the internet is a scary situation for any syste
 m administrator. We have developed an elegant solution for this problem whe
 reby we can securely execute arbitrary code not restricted to any particula
 r subset of languages.\n\nThis presentation will be going through three asp
 ects of the Challenge infrastructure. First\, how the Challenge works from 
 a competition point of view\, and how we teach programming via automated te
 sting. Second\, we will cover the sandbox we developed to facilitate this a
 rbitrary code execution. Last\, we will cover the application stack powerin
 g the Challenge site itself.
